Machine Learning Overview

Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing systems that can learn from and make decisions based on data. It enables computers to improve their performance on a task through experience without being explicitly programmed.

Types of Machine Learning:
1. Supervised Learning: Training on labeled data to predict outcomes for unseen data.
2. Unsupervised Learning: Finding patterns and relationships in unlabeled data.
3. Reinforcement Learning: Learning through interaction with an environment to maximize rewards.

Common Machine Learning Algorithms:
- Linear Regression: For predicting continuous values
- Logistic Regression: For binary classification problems
- Decision Trees: Tree-like model of decisions
- Random Forests: Ensemble of decision trees
- Support Vector Machines: For classification and regression
- Neural Networks: Inspired by the human brain

Machine learning has applications in various fields including healthcare, finance, natural language processing, computer vision, and autonomous vehicles.
