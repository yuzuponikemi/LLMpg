Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field at the intersection of computer science, artificial intelligence, and linguistics that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. The goal of NLP is to enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a valuable way.

Core NLP Tasks:
1. Tokenization: Breaking text into words, phrases, or other meaningful elements
2. Part-of-speech Tagging: Identifying grammatical parts of speech for each word
3. Named Entity Recognition: Identifying and classifying named entities in text
4. Sentiment Analysis: Determining the emotional tone behind text
5. Machine Translation: Translating text from one language to another
6. Question Answering: Generating answers to natural language questions
7. Text Summarization: Creating concise summaries of longer documents

Modern NLP Approaches:
- Rule-based Systems: Using hand-crafted linguistic rules
- Statistical Methods: Using probabilistic models trained on large corpora
- Deep Learning: Using neural networks, especially transformer architectures like BERT, GPT, and T5

Applications of NLP:
- Virtual Assistants: Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant
- Search Engines: Understanding search queries and ranking results
- Customer Service: Chatbots and automated support systems
- Content Analysis: Analyzing and categorizing large amounts of text data
- Healthcare: Medical records analysis and clinical decision support
