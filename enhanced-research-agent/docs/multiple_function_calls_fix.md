# Multiple Function Calls Fix

## Issue Description

The LLM was attempting to make multiple function calls in a single response, but the agent code was only processing the first function call and ignoring the rest. This led to an error:

```
400 Please ensure that the number of function response parts is equal to the number of function call parts of the function call turn.
```

## Solution Implemented

We've implemented several changes to handle this situation:

1. **Detection of Multiple Function Calls**:
   - Added a `get_function_calls` utility function that returns all function calls in a response.
   - Added logging when multiple function calls are detected.

2. **Enhanced Error Handling in Model Manager**:
   - Modified the `send_message` method to detect multiple function calls.
   - When multiple calls are detected, it constructs a new prompt asking the model to make only one function call at a time.
   - Implements a retry mechanism to handle this specific case.

3. **Modified Core Agent Functions**:
   - Updated `handle_function_call` to recognize when there are multiple function calls but only process the first one.
   - Enhanced the `_execute_step` method to use the new `get_function_calls` method.
   - Added logging when skipping additional function calls.

4. **Updated System Instruction**:
   - Added explicit instruction to the system prompt that tells the LLM to make only ONE function call at a time.
   - This should reduce the frequency of this issue occurring in the first place.

5. **New Logger Function**:
   - Added `log_multiple_function_calls_detected` to the interaction logger to track these occurrences.

## How to Test

Run the provided test script:

```bash
python examples/test_multiple_function_calls.py
```

This script tests the agent with a query likely to trigger multiple function calls (comparing data about two different cities) and validates that the agent handles it correctly.

## Future Improvements

While the current implementation handles the issue by only processing one function call at a time, a more advanced solution could:

1. Process multiple function calls in sequence automatically.
2. Implement a more sophisticated state machine to manage complex multi-step interactions.
3. Add special handling for common paired calls (e.g., search followed by browsing).

These improvements would require more significant changes to the agent architecture and are left for future work.
